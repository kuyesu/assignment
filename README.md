### Project description
There is already a tremendous number of users creating Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) on social platforms.  
Harvesting such data with the help of machine learning methods yields promising opportunities for businesses and public sectors to create additional business value through mining their internal and external data sources.
<br>
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential of using natural language processing and machine learning to identify relevant articles from social media platforms about usersâ€™ preferences in consumption of products. This information will be used to draw conclusions and used in advertisements of products.
